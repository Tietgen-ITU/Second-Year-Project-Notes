# What is agile planning?

What is the difference between Product backlog and Sprint backlog?
> Type answer here...

## Story points
Story points is a relative measure for how the task would be. It is a combination of different factors that you take into account in order to measure how the task would be compared to the others.

## Ideal time
Ideal time is the best possible time the task would take. 

It is how long something will take if:
- It's all you work on
- No one interrupts you
- And everything you need is available

### Elapsed time vs. Ideal time

The ideal time does not really exist. For that reason it is a bad way to estimate.

In product backlog we use story points. In a sprint backlog we use hours.

Do not take the story points and compare them to the hours in the sprint backlog.

# Transparency, inspection, and adaptation
It is important to make work visible.
We can do so by using burn-down and burn-up charts.

It is important to do so in order to make decisions in terms of estimation.
