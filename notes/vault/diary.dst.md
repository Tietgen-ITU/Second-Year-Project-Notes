# Main points learned
Before we began our project we first got an introduction to the game and what this were about. We were supposed to practice scrum. That includes *Release planning*, *Sprint planning*, and *Retrospectives*. This exercise included a product backlog with defined work items which we as a team could either start work on or break down and start to estimate with points.

## Comunication
The one thing that i did notice while doing the scrum simulation was that communication while doing the sprint was a key factor to success. A lot of us did not know how to do or solve specific tasks. And some of us did not have the neccessary ressources to perform the specific tasks. When we could communicate and talk about our challenges, then every thing want a lot smoother and you didn't really feel that you have failed the team. 

### Sound up
This leads to a special thing that i noticed. In other projects that we had team members could be a bit shy of telling other about their struggles which ultimately leads to the team falling behind.
This was not the case while playing DST with this group. This group was particular good at communicating difficulties and tell that they need help in order to move on. We were not afraid to tell the rest of the group that we do not have the knowledge to move on and that we needed another person in the team to come look at the task in order to get it solved. 

This was very beneficial because the team could move on. We did not get stuck, becuase the person who should deliver some stuff that other team members were dependent upon, did deliver in time.

## Being aware of the definition of done
We were quick to come up with a camp which was acceptable of the definition of done. When we prioritized the product backlog with the PO we quickly noticed that in the definition of done that items needs to be stored. And also our team could use that. Therefor it was both a key point for us and the PO that a *chest* was made at the beginning.

## Time, Estimation, Velocity, and workload
We planning the sprint we had a tendency to underestimate our velocity. In the first sprint we had clear off all of tasks way before the "deadline" of the sprint. 
We as a team were good at asking for tasks. Either we took more tasks from the backlog, or else we looked ahead in the product backlog and started to gather and prepare materials for the next possible tasks in the future. 

However, the overestimation of tasks were actually better because the feeling I got was that this is going well and i wanted to keep going. It sort of keeps us motivated and gives the feeling of progress. 

## Knowledge
In our simulation we noticed that it was very nice to have someone who had some knowledge of what needed to be done in order to solve the task. To have some sort of an overview. This gave us the possibility to plan ahead e.g. we could plan an attack on a spider nest with a team of 3 to get the materials we needed to move on with future tasks.

# Reflections
The learning experience was good. It was very nice to apply the theori in practice. It could sometimes be hard to take in all the information from the lectures and link all terms, processes, and words together. For that reason it was nice to experience the whole process of doing the differenct kinds of scrum meetings and experience how we as a team function when we are under pressure. 

It was for example nice to see what to do when there are not any work items left in the sprint when the sprint is not done. To experience that before the real project was started was nice. Now i know that a talk with the scrum master or PO is neccessary and that if they are not available we can take the first prioritized work item in the product backlog and start work on that.

# Simulation format
This simulation was a nice, fun and safe environment to experince how the scrum framework works. We were all a bit under time pressure and acted quikly, but we communicated as a team and worked together. This worked as a good team building experience and was a good way to see how we as a team are acting while under time pressure. And that is what i think this experience is here for. To get a hands on feel with the real thing, and get to know each other. For that reason i really enjoyed the hands on experience. It was very fun
