# Main points learned
-	WHAT were the main things you learned during the simulation? Include the three most important observations related to the use of Scrum or other work methods.
-	HOW did you learn those things? 
-	Use sub-headings, for example: 


## Topic one

## Topic two

## Topic three

# Reflections
-	How was the learning experience as a whole?
-	Discuss and compare what you learned during the simulation to earlier material/lectures/own experiences/own opinions etc (indicate clearly the source - IMPORTANT!!). Here you may also contrast Scrum in the simulation to Scrum in actual software development.
