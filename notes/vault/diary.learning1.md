#### Friday 18th of february
Today we had our first kick of meeting with our Product Owner form DSV. We got introduced to the technical specialist at the firm and set our common goals and expectation.

Also we sat together afterwards as a team to sort of set common expectations and to sort of set our group identity. Do our educational purposes come first or do the company come first. How do we view our selves. We decided that we want to learn something new, and that our education comes first. But we do expect us to deliver because we belive in our techincal abilities. 

It was nice to have a sit down and to sort of get these things into paper and talk about them.

Today we had our first Sprint Planing. We have an interesting goal where we cannot really measure if it has been succeded or not. It is something like if we have gain enough knowledge.
However, now we have gotten access to the environments and can now start to work on the project. 

Also we did planing poker today... which did not go terrible. But i think that i comes more down to the tasks which is more "acquire this and that knowledge", "research this and that", etc. It is a bit hard to estimate with story points these tasks. Becuase these things are unknown for us. Also what goes into the story points? We didn't really talked about it. But maybe we should?

#### Friday 4th of February
Today we held a short daily standup meeting which was short and nice. It was nice to have a meeting which wasn't that long in order to just get going. We were very productive or at least it felt so today.


#### Monday 7th of February
Today we started with a small "where are we"-meeting. This was to sort of get a status of where we are and in which direction we want to go. 
It took a while, but i think something good came out of it and that was that we could go in these different directions and create small POC's to see what we have learned could be applied to the situation. 

A good thing to notice here is that although we weren't supposed to have a estimation of a "new" items and user stories then we did anyways. And i think an improvement from last time is that we actually keept it shorter than the last time. We did not have such hugh discussions about why and why not. So we keept it a bit short and tried again until we reached concensus. This was especially nice since it did not take as long time as it used to. 

The most of the day we worked together and tried to solve our tasks. We have had good communication so far and help each other.
