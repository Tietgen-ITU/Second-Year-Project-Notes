#### Friday 18th of january
Today we had our first kick of meeting with our Product Owner form DSV. We got introduced to the technical specialist at the firm and set our common goals and expectation.

Also we sat together afterwards as a team to sort of set common expectations and to sort of set our group identity. Do our educational purposes come first or do the company come first. How do we view our selves. We decided that we want to learn something new, and that our education comes first. But we do expect us to deliver because we belive in our techincal abilities. 

It was nice to have a sit down and to sort of get these things into paper and talk about them.
